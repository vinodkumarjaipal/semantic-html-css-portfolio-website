## 📄 Project Description
This portfolio website was created during my learning phase as a **Software Engineering student** to practice building real-world layouts using semantic HTML and CSS.

The project emphasizes proper use of semantic tags such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer` to improve structure, accessibility, and maintainability.

While the focus of this project is frontend development, it is part of my overall journey as a **Full-Stack Developer**, building strong and scalable foundations.
